            <h1> <span class="new_span">Shounen</span> anime</h1>
            <p>Shounen (or "sh≈çnen") is one of the most popular genres of anime. It is geared toward teenage boys and usually features a male protagonist who embarks on an adventure filled with challenges. The truth is, the world could always use more shounen anime because it is filled with several positive themes, such as believing in yourself and hard work paying off. The genre often crosses over with fantasy and action anime, and does not often focus too heavily on romance. </p>

          <h1> <span class="new_span"> Shoujo </span> anime</h1>
          <p>Shoujo is the opposite of shonen, translated in English as young girl. Shoujo focuses more on the interpersonal relationship and romance in the story rather than the fighting and action. The series tend to be more dramatic, but also still include the adventure, comedy and action that are prevalent in shonen.</p>
